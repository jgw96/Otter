[Documentation](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/starter/quick-start)

The PWABuilder pwa-starter is our opinionated, best practices, production tested starter that we use to build all of our PWAs, including [PWABuilder itself](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/posts/introducing-the-brand-new-pwa-builder/)! The pwa-starter is a starter codebase, just like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate, that uses the PWABuilder team&#39;s preferred front-end tech stack.

[![Get started with the pwa-starter!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/u3pWKpmic_k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3pWKpmic_k)

With it you get an app that:
- Has no build system to set up and no boilerplate code to add. Everything is included out of the box.
- Has a Service Worker system using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/)
- Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse out of the box
- Has everything needed to be installable in the browser
- Is ready to be package for the app stores using [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com)
- Uses the [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli) which enables emulating your production environment locally, and gets you ready for deploying to Azure Static Web Apps!

and all with just a few button clicks ðŸ˜Š.
